# Tariff_recomendation_project

Mobile operator Megaline found out: many customers use archived tariffs. They want to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra".
We have data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs (from the course project "Statistical Data Analysis"). You need to build a model for the classification problem, which selects an appropriate tariff. No preprocessing of the data is needed - it has already been done by another employee.
We need to build a model with as much accuracy as possible.

```
!Each object in the dataset is information about one user's behavior for one month!
Data Description
  colls - number of calls,
  minutes - total duration of calls in minutes,
  messages - number of sms messages,
  mb_used - used Internet traffic in Mb,
  is_ultra - what tariff was used during the month ("Ultra" - 1, "Smart" - 0).

```
